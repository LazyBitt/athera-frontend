      question: "How does Athera work?",
      answer: "You create a vault and add beneficiaries. If you don't ping your vault for a set period (you choose the duration), the smart contract automatically distributes your crypto to your beneficiaries. Your crypto stays in your wallet the whole time."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you have custody of my crypto?",
      answer: "No. Your crypto never leaves your wallet. We can't access, freeze, or move your funds. The smart contract only executes when the inactivity period is reached."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I want to cancel or change beneficiaries?",
      answer: "You can update beneficiaries, change the inactivity period, or withdraw your funds anytime. You have complete control until the smart contract executes."
    },
    {
      question: "How do beneficiaries claim their crypto?",
      answer: "When the inactivity period is reached, anyone can trigger the distribution. The smart contract automatically sends the crypto to each beneficiary's wallet based on the percentages you set."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I'm just on vacation?",
      answer: "Just ping your vault before you leave or when you get back. It takes one click. You can also set a longer inactivity period if you travel frequently."
