**Setup**

Clone and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/athera-dashboard.git
cd athera-dashboard
npm install
```

Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your configuration:
```env
# Required - Get from https://cloud.walletconnect.com/
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

# Contract addresses (Base Sepolia - pre-configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACTORY_ADDRESS=0xcddc1af8Bb8484076C77090c0bE4443AaDAB389a
NEXT_PUBLIC_EXECUTOR_ADDRESS=0xD8b833aC3243dbBDf5A105B0EA37531d9279cC76

# Optional - RPC endpoints (defaults provided)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org

# Optional - Telegram notifications

```

Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

**Wallet Connection**

Connect your Web3 wallet through RainbowKit interface. The application will prompt network switching if not on Base Sepolia. Supported wallets include MeMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect, and Rainbow.

**Depositing Funds**

Navigate to Vault tab and deposit ETH to your personal vault contract. This creates a non-custodial storage that you control. Deposited funds can be allocated to inheritance vaults or withdrawn at any time.

**Creating Inheritance Vaults**

From the Inheritance tab, initiate vault creation with the following parameters:
- Lock amount (must not exceed available vault balance)
- Countdown duration in days (minimum 7 days recommended)
- Beneficiary addresses (Ethereum addresses only)
- Distribution percentages (must sum to exactly 100%)

The smart contract validates all parameters before deployment. Each vault operates independently with its own countdown timer.

**Proof-of-Life Check-ins**

Reset vault countdown timers through the check-in function. This proves continued activity and prevents premature distribution. Check-ins can be performed at any time before countdown expiry. Consider setting calendar reminders based on your countdown duration.

**Managing Beneficiaries**

Vault owners can modify beneficiary lists and percentages post-creation. Changes take effect immediately but do not reset the countdown timer. Emergency withdrawal option allows full fund recovery with vault termination.

**IPFS Message Storage**

Upload text messages, images, or documents to IPFS through the Messages tab. Each upload generates a unique Content Identifier (CID) for permanent retrieval. Share CIDs with beneficiaries through secure channels. Content remains accessible indefinitely through IPFS gateways.

## Smart Contracts

## Architecture Details

**Automated Distribution**

Chainlink Automation monitors all active vaults through upkeep contracts. When countdown timers reach zero, the automation network triggers distribution transactions. This eliminates reliance on manual execution or centralized servers. Gas costs for automation are pre-funded through Chainlink subscription model.

**Security Model**

The protocol implements several security measures:
- Non-custodial architecture - users maintain full control until distribution
- Time-lock mechanisms prevent immediate withdrawals by unauthorized parties
- Percentage validation ensures accurate fund distribution
- Emergency withdrawal function for vault owners
- Immutable beneficiary records on-chain

**Gas Optimization**

Factory pattern with EIP-1167 minimal proxies reduces deployment costs by ~90% compared to full contract deployment. Vault operations use optimized storage patterns and batch operations where possible.

**IPFS Integration**

Content addressing through IPFS provides censorship-resistant storage for sensitive documents. The application supports multiple IPFS providers (Pinata, Infura, local nodes). CIDs are stored off-chaie gas costs while maintaining verifiability.

## Development
